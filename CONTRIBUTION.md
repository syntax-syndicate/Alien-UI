# Contributing to AlienUI

Thank you for considering contributing to **AlienUI**! Your contributions play a vital role in building a cutting-edge, inclusive, and highly customizable UI component library. This guide outlines how to get started and ensures a seamless contribution process for everyone involved.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository.**
2. **Clone your fork to your local machine:**

   - Clone your fork to your local machine using the following command (replace `<your-username>` and `<repository>`
     with your GitHub username and the repository name):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository>.git
   ```

3. **Add the Original Repository as a Remote:**

   - Change into the directory of your cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd <repository>
   ```

   - Add the original repository as a remote (this helps you fetch changes from the original repository):

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/<original-owner>/<repository>.git
   ```

4. **Create a Branch:**

   - Create a new branch for your contribution (replace `<branch-name>` with a meaningful name):

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <branch-name>
   ```

5. **Make Changes :**
   - Pick a task or feature you'd like to work on. Check out the [Issues](https://github.com/khaymanii/AlienUI/issues) tab for open task.
   - Review the project structure, `next-ui` and `playground` folder to familiarize yourself with the project and build your UI components.
   - Fix or build the task assigned to you on the `issues` tab, and then attach an image or recorded video to the Pull request (PR) of the UI you built.
6. **Committing Changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add your descriptive commit message here"
   ```

7. **Fetch and Rebase from Upstream:**

   - Before pushing your changes, fetch the latest changes from the original repository and rebase your branch:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

   - Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur.

8. **Push your changes to your fork:**

   - Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

9. **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
   - Visit your fork on GitHub and switch to the branch you just pushed.
   - Click on the "New Pull Request" button.
   - Provide a clear and descriptive title and rendered image or recorded video for your PR.
   - Explain the purpose of your changes in the PR description.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards.
- Be responsive to feedback and make necessary adjustments.

**N/B:** AlienUI uses Firebase to manage the form database. Incase you encounter any error while configuring in your local machine, you can setup your own firebase project and populate you API KEY in your .env file. Just for testing purpose.
